#### I'm a Computer Science student who loves turning ideas into real, functional web applications.
#### Deeply interested in both frontend and backend development â€” I enjoy designing responsive, interactive user interfaces just as much as building solid APIs, databases, and application logic.
#### I believe that great software comes from attention to detail, clear code structure, and continuous learning.  
#### Over time, Iâ€™ve worked with various technologies including Java with Spring Boot, JavaScript with the different APIs, as well as system-level projects in C.
#### Whether it's a personal project, a portfolio website, or a complex web platform â€” I love the entire process of bringing a concept to life on the web.
